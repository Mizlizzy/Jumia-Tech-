# Jumia Tech support As is

Employees are assigned computers with unique inventory numbers and equipped with remote access software for support. They can report issues either through the desktop software or by emailing support@Jumia-Tech.com, which generates a ticket logged in the queue.

Tech support agents monitor the queue, addressing tickets in order. They remotely connect to the employee's machine to troubleshoot. If resolved, the ticket closes with confirmation to the employee. Unresolved issues may escalate to higher support levels or require physical pickup for repair.

During repair, employees receive loaner machines. Once fixed, the original machine is returned, and the loaner goes back to inventory.
